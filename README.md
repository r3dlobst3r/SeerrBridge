## 🚀 What is SeerrBridge?

🌉 **SeerrBridge** is a browser automation tool that integrates [Jellyseer](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr)/[Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) with [Debrid Media Manager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/debrid-media-manager). It listens to movie requests in Discord and automates the torrent search and download process using Debrid Media Manager via browser automation, which in turn, gets sent to Real-Debrid. This streamlines your media management, making it fast and efficient.

🛠️ **Why SeerrBridge?** 

**SeerrBridge** eliminates the need to set up multiple applications like [Radarr](https://radarr.video/), [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/), [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett), [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr), and other download clients. With SeerrBridge, you streamline your media management into one simple, automated process. No more juggling multiple tools—just request and download!

Simply put, I was too lazy to setup all of these other applications, and thought.... I want this instead.

### (THIS SCRIPT IS STILL IN BETA AND HAS ONLY BEEN PROPERLY TESTED / RUN ON WINDOWS)

## ⚙ Requirements

Before you can run this bot, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

### 1. **Jellyseerr / Overseerr Notifications**
  - You can follow the Jellyseerr documention on getting [notifications into Discord](https://docs.jellyseerr.dev/using-jellyseerr/notifications/discord).

### Currently, the script is looking for the request coming in as "Movie Request Automatically Approved". Therefore, you should set your user requests to be approved automatically for this to properly function.

### 2. **Real-Debrid Account**
   - You will need a valid [Real-Debrid](https://real-debrid.com/) account to authenticate and interact with the Debrid Media Manager.
     - **Username** and **Password** for your Real-Debrid account will be required for the bot to log in.

### 3. **Discord Bot**
   - Create a Discord bot and invite it to your server:
     1. Follow the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a new application.
     2. Add a bot to your application.
     3. Copy the **Bot Token** and **Channel ID** where the bot will listen for commands.
     4. Give your bot the necessary permissions (e.g., `MESSAGE_READ`, `MESSAGE_WRITE`, and `MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent).

### 4. **ChromeDriver**
   - [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads) is required to automate browser tasks using Selenium.
     - Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your installed version of Google Chrome.
       - Download it manually and provide the path in your `.env` file.

### 5. **Python 3.10.11+**
   - The bot requires **Python 3.10.11** or higher. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Ensure that `pip` (Python's package installer) is installed and up-to-date by running:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```

### 6. **Required Python Libraries**
   - The following Python libraries are required and will be installed automatically if you run the `pip install` command:
     - `discord.py`
     - `selenium`
     - `python-dotenv`
     - `webdriver-manager`
   - You can install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## 🛤️ Roadmap

- [ ] **Faster Processing**: Implement concurrency to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- [ ] **TV Show Support**: Extend functionality to handle TV series and episodes. (COMING SOON)
- [ ] **Jellyseer/Overseer API Integration**: Direct integration with Jellyseer/Overseer API for smoother automation and control.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Discord Integration**: SeerrBridge listens for movie requests in a designated Discord channel.
2. **Automated Search**: It uses Selenium to automate the search for movies on Debrid Media Manager site.
3. **Torrent Fetching**: Once a matching torrent is found, SeerrBridge automates the Real-Debrid download process.
4. **Queue Management**: Requests are added to a queue and processed one by one, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

If you want to see the automation working in realtime, you can edit the code and add a # to the headless line

This will launch a visible Chrome browser. Be sure not to mess with it while its operating or else you will break the current action / script and need a re-run.
